/*
 * 🎌 Implementation Notes for Fellow Sufferers:
 *
 * - Every 'new' must have a corresponding 'delete' (unlike Gintoki's rent payments)
 * - Use C++98 standard (NULL instead of nullptr, like we're living in the past)
 * - Check for null pointers (because segfaults are not funny... okay they're a little funny)
 * - Memory leaks will make Otae angrier than usual
 * - When in doubt, ask yourself: "What would Shinpachi do?" (Then do the opposite)
 *
 * Good luck! You'll need it more than Gintoki needs his strawberry milk.
